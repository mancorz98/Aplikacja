## Simple Application for memristor programing using kivy and nidaqmx

This application is based on pulse based memristor programing method. 
This simple gui was prepered for the studends at AGH to explore memristors on the laboratory table. It constains modified MemProgrammer class which you can find at: [memristor-programing](https://github.com/mancorz98/memristor_programing).

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
